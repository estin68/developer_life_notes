## Using Git in your WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment

1. Check Git Version:
 - First, ensure that you have the correct Git version installed. Newer versions might use different executables for credential management.
 - Run the following command to check your Git version:
```git --version```

2. Configure Git Credential Manager:
- If there is no git-credential-core.exe in your Git folder, use the -wincred variant instead (if it exists).
- Execute the following command in your WSL2 terminal:
```
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-core.exe"
```
If the above command fails or doesn’t solve the problem, try using `-wincred` instead:
```
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-wincred.exe"
```

3. Explanation:
- The executable git-credential-manager-core.exe has likely been renamed to git-credential-wincred.exe. Many tutorials on the internet still reference the old name, confusing.
- By configuring Git to use the correct executable, you’ll avoid the authentication prompt every time you interact with a GitHub remote repository from your local WSL2 environment.
